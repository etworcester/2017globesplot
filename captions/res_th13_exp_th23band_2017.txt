The resolution on $sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ as a function of exposure in kt-MW-years, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The dashed line is the sensitivity for the NuFit central value of $\theta_{23}$ and the width of the band represents the range of sensitivities for the 90% C.L. range in $\theta_{23}$ values. Note that the $sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ resolution is actually best at the central value of $\theta_{23}$, such that the top of the band corresponds to the highest $\theta_{23}$ value and the bottom of the band corresponds to the nominal $\theta_{23}$ value, with the lowest $\theta_{23}$ value falling in between.
