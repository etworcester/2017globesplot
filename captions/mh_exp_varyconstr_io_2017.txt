The significance with which the neutrino mass ordering can be determined as a function of exposure in kt-MW-years, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True inverted ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The width of the band corresponds to the difference between the nominal analysis (solid line) where all external constraints on oscillation parameters are applied and a "DUNE-only" analysis (dashed line) where only external constraints on the solar oscillation parameters are applied. The single curve shows the significance when $\delta_{CP} = - \pi/2$, which is the minimum significance for 100% of true $\delta_{CP}$ values.
