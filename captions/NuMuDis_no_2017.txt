Reconstructed energy distribution of selected $\nu_{\mu}$ CC-like events assuming a 3.5 year exposure, where the number of years are based on the DUNE staging scenario, in the neutrino-beam mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameters are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs.
