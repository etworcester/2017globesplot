The significance with which CP violation, defined as $\delta_{CP}$ not equal to zero or pi, can be determined as a function of exposure in kt-MW-years, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The width of the band corresponds to the difference in sensitivity between $\nu_{e}$ signal normalization uncertainty of 1% and 3%. The nominal uncertainty of 5% on the $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance mode and 2% on the $\nu_{e}$ appearance mode is shown as the solid line. The three curves show the significance when $\delta_{CP} = - \pi/2$ and the minimum significance for 50% and 75% of true $\delta_{CP}$ values.
