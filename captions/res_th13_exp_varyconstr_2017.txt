The resolution on $sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ as a function of exposure in kt-MW-years, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. There is no significant difference between the nominal analysis where all external constraints on oscillation parameters are applied and a "DUNE-only" analysis where only external constraints on the solar oscillation parameters are applied, so only a single curve is shown.
