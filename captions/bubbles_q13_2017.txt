Two-dimensional allowed region at 90% C.L. in $sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ vs. $\delta_{CP}$ for exposures of seven (green), ten (orange), and fifteen (blue) years, where the number of years are based on the DUNE staging scenario, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. The three sets of contours represent different assumed true values of $\delta_{CP}$, indicated by the stars. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The yellow region is the two-dimensional 90% C.L. region from NuFit 2016.
