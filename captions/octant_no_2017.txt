The significance with which DUNE can resolve the $\theta_{23}$ octant as a function of the true value of $sin^2\theta_{23}$, for exposures of seven (green) or ten (orange) years, where the number of years are based on the DUNE staging scenario, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The width of the band represents the range in sensitivity due to the unknown true value of $\delta_{CP}$, where the band covers the 80% of $\delta_{CP}$ values for which the sensitivity is least extreme (ie: the best and worst 10% of sensitivities are not shown). The yellow shaded region indicates the 90% C.L. allowed region for $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ from NuFit 2016.
