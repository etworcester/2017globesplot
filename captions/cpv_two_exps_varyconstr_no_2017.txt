The significance with which CP violation, defined as $\delta_{CP}$ not equal to zero or pi, can be determined as a function of the true value of $\delta_{CP}$, for exposures of seven (green) or ten (orange) years, where the number of years are based on the DUNE staging scenario, for equal running in FHC and RHC mode. True normal ordering is assumed. Oscillation parameter central values and uncertainties are based on NuFit 2016. The flux is the CDR Optimized Design. Detector and analysis performance parameters are identical to the CDR and are based on Fast MC studies. See DocDB 2329 for details on the inputs. The width of the band corresponds to the difference between the nominal analysis (solid line) where all external constraints on oscillation parameters are applied and a "DUNE-only" analysis (dashed line) where only external constraints on the solar oscillation parameters are applied.
